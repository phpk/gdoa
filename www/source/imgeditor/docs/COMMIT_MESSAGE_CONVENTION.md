# Commit Message Convention

The commit messages of the main branch should follow the convention.

## Commit Message Format

```
<Type>: short description (fix #1234)

Longer description here if necessary

BREAKING CHANGE: only contain breaking change
```

- Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!

## Revert

```
revert: commit <short-hash>

This reverts commit <full-hash>
More description if needed
```

## Type

The type is determined by the intention.
Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- **env**: Update dependencies, Changes to environment configuration files(package.json, elintrc, babelrc, webpack-config. browserlist, etc)

## Subject

- use the imperative, **present** tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
- reference GitHub issues at the end. If the commit doesnâ€™t completely fix the issue, then use `(refs #1234)` instead of `(fixes #1234)`.

## Body

- use the imperative, **present** tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## BREAKING CHANGE

- This commit contains breaking change(s).
- start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

This convention is based on [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests#step2)
