## Checklist

Note that we require UI tests to ensure that the added feature will not be
nixed by some future fix and that there is at least some test-as-documentation
to indicate how the fix or enhancement is expected to behave.

- [ ] - Added Cypress UI tests
- [ ] - Ran `npm test`, ensuring linting passes and that Cypress UI tests keep
        coverage to at least the same percent (reflected in the coverage badge
        that should be updated after the tests run)
- [ ] - Added any user documentation. Though not required, this can be a big
        help both for future users and for the PR reviewer.
