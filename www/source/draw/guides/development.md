# Development

From the root folder:

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

- Run `yarn start` to start the development server for the package and for the example.

- Open `localhost:5420` to view the example project.

**Note:** The multiplayer examples and endpoints currently require an API key from [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/), however the storage services that are used in tldraw are currently in alpha and (as of November 2021) not accessible to the general public. You won't be able to authenticate and run these parts of the project.

Other scripts:

- Run `yarn test` to execute unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

- Run `yarn docs` to build the docs via [ts-doc](https://typedoc.org/).
